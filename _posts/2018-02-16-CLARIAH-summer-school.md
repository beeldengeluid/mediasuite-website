This one-week event, organized by CLARIAH (Media studies team) introduces scholars from different domains to the CLARIAH Media Suite and other tools which support the exploration, search and analysis of important _Dutch_ audio-visual collections and their contextual data. 

In the summer school, participants will follow tutorials about using the CLARIAH Media suite in combination with other tools for data analysis and visualization. The Media Suite ([http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/](https://clariah.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4aa8a65873d3ffafe259b732d&id=1c03ddfa2c&e=945d5a62a7)) offers a user-friendly research environment with tools that support the research process, following the principles of data transparency. It provides facilities to search, browse, and work with manual & and automatic annotations and enrichments (such as automatic speech recognition). In the summer school, you will work in small groups with scholars (e.g., media scholars and historians), information experts, and other participants on small research projects.

### Short Lessons

**Lesson 1: Search strategies, data and tool criticism**

Marijn Koolen, senior researcher and scientific programer in the field of Digital Humanities, Information retrieval and Information Science will introduce the participants to the principles of search and information retrieval, data and tool criticism.

**Lesson 2: Qualitative data analysis and scholarly annotations**

Liliana Melgar, postdoctoral researcher in the field of Information Science, will introduce the participants to methods of computed-assisted qualitative data analysis, and to the audio-visual annotation tool offered by the CLARIAH Media Suite.

**Lesson 3: Introduction to Automatic Speech Recognition technologies**

Roeland Ordelman, technical coordinator of the audio-visual services in the CLARIAH infrastructure, expert on hypervideo and automatic speech recognition (ASR), will introduce the participants to the fundamentals of ASR and the ASR services offered by CLARIAH.

**Lesson 4: Introduction to data visualization**

Hugo Huurdeman, PhD in the field of Information Science, and leader of the "Visual Navigation Project" at the University of Oslo, will introduce the participants to the fundamentals of data visualization and to useful tips and tools for digital humanists.

**Lesson 5: Introduction to data visualizations with a Jupyter Notebook**

Carlos Martínez, research software engineer at the Netherlands eScienceCenter, will show the potentials of using Python programming via a Jupyter notebook for visualizing and analyzing data.

### Group projects

Participants are be invited to join the "sample projects" prepared for the school, which include, among others: Public debate about the Refugee Crisis; Platformization of Public Service Broadcasting; Remediating Culture: The Case of Dutch cinema; Historical changes in Dutch Documentary filmmaking; Gender, ethnicity and representation in Dutch current affairs programs over time; an oral history project; and a project on the use of the (first time online!) Jean Desmet Collection. Scholars will be able to work for the first time with the automatic speech transcripts of a portion of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision's collection.

Project work will be supported by leading digital humanities experts and media scholars, including Julia Noordegraaf, Roeland Ordelman, Marijn Koolen, Jaap Blom, Willem Melder, Jasmijn van Gorp, Thomas Poell, Eva Baaren, Norah Karrouche, Kaspar Beelen, Liliana Melgar, Victor de Boer, Carlos Martínez Ortíz, Mari Wigham. Participants will have the possibility to work together with the CLARIAH research pilot projects scholars, including Marcel Broersma, Susan Aasman, Susan Hoogervorst, Christian Olesen, Sabrina Sauer, Berber Hagedoorn, Berrie van der Molen, among others.

### Closing panel

The summer school will close with a panel on digital methods and new methods in Media Studies. The panelists are leading researchers and experts in the field: Jasmijn van Gorp (Utrecht University), Thomas Poell (University of Amsterdam), Kaspar von Beelen (University of Amsterdam), Karina van Dalen-Oskam (CLARIAH), Jaap Verheul (Utrecht University), Marijn Koolen (Huygens), Marcel Broersma (University of Groningen), and Steven Claeyssens (National Library of The Netherlands). They will discuss the methodological implications and the need for data and tool criticism.
