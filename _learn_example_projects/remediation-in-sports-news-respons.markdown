\# Remediation in Sports News (ReSpoNs)![respons_image.png](/uploads/respons_image.png)Funded through the CLARIAH Research Pilot grant scheme which ran between 2017-2018, the project "Remediation in Sports News" (University of Groningen) studied how sports journalism in newspapers has changed in response to the rise of television between 1959 and 1989. By means of AVResearcherXL (a precursor to the Media Suite's *Inspect* tool) the project explored how remediation between these two media can be operationalized, empirically investigated over time and visualized.
