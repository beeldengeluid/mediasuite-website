# Debate Research Across Media: Cross media research of public debates on drugs and regulation (DReAM)

Funded through the CLARIAH Research Pilot grant scheme which ran between 2017-2018, the project "Debate Research Across Media: Cross media research of public debates on drugs and regulation" (Utrecht University) studied the role of historical public debates on drugs and regulation (1945-1990) in newspapers, on radio and television. Attending to how debates have changed and become fragmented as drugs (e.g. heroin, amphetamines and cannabis) move between medical, criminal and recreational spheres the project studied the historically dynamic relation between governmental drug regulation and public discourse using a combined distant and close reading approach.
