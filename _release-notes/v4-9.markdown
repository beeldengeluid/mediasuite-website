## New features

The new resource viewer is there! It includes:

- Separate (hideable) column for displaying "content annotations" such as speech transcripts and/or curated (program) segments
- Separate (hideble) column for displaying your personal annotations
- Word cloud navigation for "content annotations": skip through AV content by clicking words in the cloud
- UI shows clear distinction between "Resource", "Media Object" and "Segment" level annotations
- Filters for showing/hiding the different annotation types: comments, codes, links or metadata (a.k.a. information cards)

Other features:

- The "Empty field" in each filter/facet block shows how many documents do not have a value filled in for the metadata field that underlies the filter.
- You can now click on the individual years in the timeline graph to filter search results by that year
- It's now possible to use the "Compare queries" tool via the workspace
