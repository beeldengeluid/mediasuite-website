After a few releases (6.1-3) without functional updates (but a lot of changes 'under the hood' to make Media Suite more stable) we are proud to present a new release with the following updates:

*  Media Suite provide access to **recent Radio & Television** content with only a short delay (in days)
*  [Media Suite Data](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/) now has more information on the **[Program Guides](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset?q=program+guides)** that can be accessed via the Media Suite.
* You can now use **term chart visualisation** that shows a histogram or a line chart with the amount of documents (relative or absolute) that match your query, distributed over the values of your chosen metadata field. See these [help docs](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/howtos/search#term-charts) for more info.  
* You can also use **charts in the 'Compare Tool'** to visualise differences between datasets (that you can create yourself using 'queries'). See these [help docs](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/howtos/compare-queries) for more information.
* You may notice when selecting NISV content that NISV has a new logo as of today!
