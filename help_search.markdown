The CLARIAH Media Suite is intended primarily as a **research tool** for scholars interested in **data science** with media collections maintained at institutes in the Netherlands such as Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, National Library, Eye Film Institute, DANS, Meertens Institute, etc. The Media Suite provides specific tools for researchers to search, analyse and annotate these data collections. In this documentation section we aim to provide all the necessary information needed to work with the Media Suite, in the form of:

- [Quick Start Guide](/documentation/quick-start-guide)

- [Frequently Asked Questions](/documentation/faq)

- [Howtos](/documentation/howtos)

- [Troubleshooting information for known issues](/documentation/troubleshooting)

- [Glossary of terms](/documentation/glossary)

For **reporting issues, asking questions or providing feedback** we setup fora that can be found via the [Fora for Support & Discussion](/documentation/forum) page. 

The **terms of use and privacy statement** of the Media Suite can be read [here](/documentation/privacy-statement).
