## New reflexivity features

Reflexivity features can now be enabled for each project in your workspace. When active, the Media Suite offers various new options for providing context to made projects, annotations and bookmark groups.

Depending on the type of research, this additional (reflective) context could improve unambiguously interpeting your research data by others and/or your future self.


## New Similarity search tool available

A limited part of the Sound and Vision Archive now has keyframe images available, which can be found using the `Only resources with keyframes [Experimental]` option available below the main search bar in the [Search tool](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/tool/single-search).

Results found using this option can be inspected in the new (experimental) Similarity search tool, which can bes used to find similar audiovisual content within the Sound and Vision collection.


## Improved FactRank tool

The FactRank tool now integrates with the [BENEDMO FactCheck Database](https://factcheck.benedmo.eu)
