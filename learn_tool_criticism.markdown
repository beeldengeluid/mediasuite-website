Through a number of initiatives, Learn stimulates critical reflection on the tools and functionalities it makes available in the Media Suite environment to support criticality and transparency in digital scholarship. To achieve this, Learn invites Media Suite users to reflect on both the social and technical processes through which tools and software are built, data created, and collections made available and analysed. Through this page we offer ways of accessing the the codes and data at the backend of the Media Suite while also offering examples on how to critically reflect on teaching and researching with the Media Suite.
