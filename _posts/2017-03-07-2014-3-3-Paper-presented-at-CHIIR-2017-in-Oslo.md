Based on the data gathered during the first CLARIAH Media Studies workshop held on March 24, 2016, we are happy to present our accepted contribution to the ACM SIGIR Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval (CHIIR). It describes the manual annotating practices of media scholars and other scholars who use audio-visual media intensively, and proposes a scholarly process model of media annotation.
