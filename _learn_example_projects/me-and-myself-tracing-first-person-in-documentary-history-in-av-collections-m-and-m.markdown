# Me and Myself: Tracing first person in documentary history in AV-collections (M&M)

Funded through the CLARIAH Research Pilot grant scheme which ran between 2017-2018, the project "Me and Myself: Tracing first person in documentary history in AV-collections" (University of Groningen) traced the transformation in Dutch documentary from traditional objective documentary as a fair and fact minded genre towards one with an appreciation for a more personal and subjective style. In so doing, one of the project's key aims was to devise a method for reconstructing the development of a genre based on analysing oral and visual cues related to a set of genre conventions: a common theme or subject matter, manner of presentation and associated emotions.
