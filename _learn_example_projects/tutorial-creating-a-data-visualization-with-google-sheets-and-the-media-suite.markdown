Using the CLARIAH Media Suite, Jasmijn van Gorp and Mary-Joy van der Deure (Utrecht University) have developed a tutorial around the creation of data visualizations as part of the [RE-FRAME project](https://www.clicknl.nl/case/pps-projecten-re-frame/). This tutorial helps participants turn data from the CLARIAH Media Suite into a visualization in Google Sheets. At the same time, the tutorial lets participants reflect upon their steps from a critical data studies perspective. \

Following their research, they also made a search guide to finding NOS journaals in the Mediasuite:
