**Principle Investigator:** Dr. Berber Hagedoorn, Assistant Professor Media Studies & Audiovisual Culture (RUG), b.hagedoorn@rug.nl

**Project Period:** October 1, 2021 to 1 July 2022

How do Dutch and international MA students, experienced in media creation and innovation, use the English-language content and collections in the CLARIAH Media Suite for creative storytelling practices: to search, contextualize and share the Media Suite’s cultural heritage content, and to engage users with it? The CLARIAH Media Suite provides online access to Dutch audiovisual cultural heritage (such as television, film and radio) and contextual (meta)data. The project has a three-pronged approach – focusing on the interaction of (a) content, (b) platform, and (c) user – to dig into and understand Media Suite use for multimodal storytelling purposes. Understanding storytelling in various forms as a sense-making practice and as a socio-technical practice, this project combines platform engagement analysis with user analysis, both via survey analysis and co-creative user-laboratory sessions. This approach triangulates insights into perspectives on digital storytelling and media use with first-hand observations of Media Suite use, to create (make) new creative storytelling products or experiences. It uncovers how students in the international classroom perceive the Media Suite platform as an effective storytelling tool.
