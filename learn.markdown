Welcome to Media Suite Learn, the Media Suite's teaching and training initiative. Learn aims to help university lecturers, researchers and students in using the digital audiovisual collections and tools made available in the Media Suite in their teaching, research and study activities. In order to achieve this, Learn offers both concrete examples of research projects and tutorials made for various levels that make use of the Media Suite as well as research support. Learn also regularly co-organizes events focussing more broadly on access and reuse of digital collections and the use of digital methods and videographic approaches in a wide range of disciplines and approaches - in particular media studies, film and television studies, oral history and history. 

The following is a list of key activities, ressources and types of support that Learn offers and which you will find more information on in the various sections of the Learn page:

* **Media Suite Tutorials:** Learn offers tutorials tailored to different levels of user expertise ranging from beginner's to advanced levels. The tutorials can be accessed based on subject or tool. Learn offers written, video and hybrid tutorials. These can be found on the tabs "Subject Tutorials" and "Tool Tutorials" respectively.

* **A research resource:** Learn provides examples of how the collections and tools made available within the Media Suite environment may be used and implemented in teaching and research. This entails a repository of projects and articles focussing on concrete projects, cases and research questions that have been explored using the Media Suite and which may offer inspiration for researchers in developing their own projects. This resource can be found under the tab "Example Projects".

* **Advice and support: **The Learn team aims to support a wide array of approaches and areas of teaching and research, and we are happy to offer advice on how to use the Media Suite productively in your own project. You can reach out to us via [mediastudies@clariah.nl](mailto:mediastudies@clariah.nl)

* **A hub for digital methods and videographic approaches in the Netherlands:** With the Media Suite as the central university level access point for digital audiovisual collections and digital tools for analysis of audiovisal materials, Learn aims to be a hub for digital, audiovisual scholarship in the Netherlands and to stimulate new approaches to teaching and researching media. To achieve this, our team regularly contributes to organizing research events that introduce the Media Suite to new users, as well as events that reflect on digital methods and videographic approaches more broadly. Until now, this has entailed organizing online webinars focussing on the Media Suite, as well as organizing public research seminars focussing on state-of-the-art digital scholarship with contributions from scholars from the Netherlands and abroad. Learn's research events are hosted by Utrecht University, where the Learn initiative is currently based.
