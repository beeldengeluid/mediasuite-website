# The Discovery and Evaluation of Serendipitous Information Encountering in CLARIAH’s Media Suite

**Principal Investigator:** Dr. Sabrina Sauer, Assistant Professor Media Studies (RUG)

**Project Period:** October 1, 2021 to July 1, 2022

This Teaching Fellowship proposal aimed at training BA and MA students of the University of Groningen’s Digital Humanities minor and MA programs in assessing and evaluating serendipitous information encountering by focusing specifically on (Digital) Humanities students’ interaction with CLARIAH’s Media Suite. Methodologically, students were taught how to use and develop exploratory search tasks, research diaries, and video recorded search journeys as part of their own user studies. Teaching efforts culminated in student insights into how digital tools such as the Media Suite shape search and discovery processes within the(Digital) Humanities. Based on these activities, the Fellowship developed teaching materials that allow students to practice doing user studies and tool criticism to map serendipitous information encountering of peers (students of other humanities programs within the University of Groningen). In addition, the project's deliverables included a list of user requirements and suggestions for the Media Suite. These materials may be accessed below.

**Teaching Materials and Project Deliverables**

***Mini Video Lecture Series***

In a series of four short video lectures between 5-12 minutes, DISCERN Principal Investigator Sabrina Sauer guides you through the analysis and evaluation of serendipitous information encountering, covering an introduction to exploratory search (Part 1), the principles and design of a tool critical exercise (Part 2), a user study use case (Part 3), and a final reflection on the insights reached during the fellowship (Part 4).
