Saved queries
---

When using the Search tool of the Media Suite, users create queries using different search parameters (e.g., date filters). The Media Suite allows users to save these queries for further reference in their Workspace, and for comparing results using the Compare tool.

The query parameters stored are the following:

- Selected collection
- Search expression (the search terms and Boolean operators)
- The field cluster(s) used for the query (e.g., if the search was done in the titles, descriptions, subtitles, etc.)
- The selected date field, and the date range (i.e., start date and end date)
- The facet name and the facet terms used for filtering (e.g., Broadcaster: NOS) using the default facets
- The facet name and the facet terms used for filtering (e.g., Colour: zwart/wit) using the user-added facets
- The ordering option chosen for the search results (e.g., per date)

### How to use

- Select your User project
- Use the "Save query" button in the Search tool

- You will be asked to store the query assigning it a name

![](/uploads/saved_queries_dialogbox.png)

- You can find your stored query in the Workspace (going to the User project that you selected in the first step)

![](/uploads/saved_queries.jpg)

You can then either copy the parameters (e.g., to use it in a publication in which you would like to explain which query you used to get the data), or select the saved queries that you would like to compare with the Compare tool.
