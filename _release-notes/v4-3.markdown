## Bug fixing

- Bugs have been fixed in the Compare, Inspect, and Search tool, and in the Workspace.

## Enhancements

- Improvements to the dialog boxes and interaction menu to save queries in the Search tool.
- Improvements to the highlight function, so it is easier for users to see the matching terms to their query highlighted in the results.
- Usability improvements in the Search tool.

## New features

- Create Custom Field cluster (users can select which fields they want to search in, and create their own clusters of fields).
- It is possible to search for terms within the facets.

## Data improvements

- The workflow for adding metadata dictionaries via CKAN to the collections has been improved. It is now easier for collection owners to add and update metadata dictionaries.
- In the Jupyter notebooks, and in the [CKAN page for Oral history collections](http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset/dans-oral-history) it is possible to query and visualize the oral history aggregated collection by the time period being discussed in the interviews.
- Small improvements in the data (parsing, and cleaning date fields).
