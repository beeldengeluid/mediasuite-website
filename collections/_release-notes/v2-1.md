This version has improved bookmarking functionalities and more:

- We added functionality for bookmarking multiple search results from the single search page
- You can now organize your bookmarks by arranging them in different lists within your project (viewable in your workspace)
- Each search result now includes media type & accessibility information
- The Beeld en Geluid collection by default now shows much more genres in the "genre facet", since it is now tied to the "series level" metadata, instead of the "program level" metadata
- Miscellaneous small updates to the user interface
