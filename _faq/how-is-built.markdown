The overarching  aim of the[ CLARIAH Media Studies project](https://clariah.nl/en/work-packages/focus-areas/media-studies#workplan) is to build an environment that facilitates  access to audiovisual collections that are being made open for online research. CLARIAH supports  institutions with widening access to their collections, and provides state-of-the art tools for searching, analysing, enriching and combining data. From a methodological point of view, the Media Suite aims to translate  Unsworthâ€™s "scholarly primitives" (Unsworth, 2000) to a digital research environment, thereby offering a wide and diverse audience the means to to conduct research on digitised audiovisual collections.

The Media Suite functions as a  metadata aggregator in which  collections can be queried, enriched and
manipulated. User-friendliness and (meta)data transparency served as the guiding principles. Also, the Media Suite  hopes to trigger data and tool criticism.

The creation of the Media Suite followed a co-development approach: the interface was designed in continuous interaction with users. From the start, scholars have been actively involved in formulating the requirements, and prototyping (or testing) the interface. The CLARIAH project contained broadly two stages:

- In the first stage (from 2015 to 2017), the software engineers and developers with the input from scholars in the CLARIAH team, created the foundations of the infrastructure. The initial functional and data requirements and inspiration came from prototypes created in previous projects: [AVResearcherXL](/documentation/glossary/avresearcher), [Verteld Verleden](/documentation/glossary/verteld-verleden), [DIVE+](/documentation/glossary/dive), [CoMERDa](/documentation/glossary/comerda), and [TROVe](/documentation/glossary/trove).
- In the second phase, which started in April 2017, external scholars were involved as co-developers under the framework of the [CLARIAH Research Pilot Projects](/documentation/faq/what-are-research-pilots).
- From 2018, the Media Suite continued to be further developed in the framework of [CLARIAH Plus](https://www.clariah.nl/nieuw/nieuws/clariah-plus-gehonoreerd), focussing on supporting more advanced mixed-media and audio-visual analysis methods.
