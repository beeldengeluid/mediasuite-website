### Introduction

Annotation is a concept that can be understood differently by different communities. In a digital humanities context it is agreed that annotation (i.e., adding notes, comments, selecting fragments, coding, etc.) is a scholarly primitive (Unsworth, 2000), thus, information systems should support it. Information system support for scholarly annotations is a highly relevant and current topic in the context of developing digital humanities infrastructures. Within the framework of the CLARIAH infrastructure project, this events aims to present scholarly annotation cases, ongoing annotation scholarly projects and technical implementations, in order to achieve collaboration at these different levels.

This annotation symposium aims to bring together different groups and individuals who are working separately on implementing solutions to support text annotation, audio and video annotation, and image annotation. For instance, within the CLARIAH infrastructure, there is active research and development related to video annotation. Also, the Huygens Institute is actively developing a system for supporting text annotation. Equally, projects at the European and international level are implementing solutions to support this "scholarly primitive". This event aims to provide the occasion to present an overview of research use cases, and to share experiences, problems, and ideas in implementing annotation support. The main aim is to raise awareness among all CLARIAH work packages about the need to support annotation, and to discuss collaboration possibilities within and outside CLARIAH. The event includes a full day with presentations and a hands-on workshop open to the public, and two closed expert panels.
Expected outcomes include:

* Comparing current and planned support for annotation across CLARIAH work packages, and analyze how each work package is supporting the needs of scholars using their respective media types (texts, structured data, AV media). This will also help in gaining insights in what will be needed for the future development of CLARIAH (e.g., CLARIAH Plus).
* Identifying research use cases for annotation 1) across humanities disciplines (historians, literary scholars, media scholars) and 2) across media types, i.e. text, image, audio, video and data. Discuss how annotations are created and used.
* Identifying the most challenging technical issues and get insights for solving them from other peers
* Agreeing on a common framework and roadmap for supporting multimodal annotations in the CLARIAH infrastructure (not only based on specific media types, such as text or video), as well as a roadmap for aligning agendas between important Dutch, European and international initiatives.
