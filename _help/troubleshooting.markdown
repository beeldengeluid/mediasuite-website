Here we list some reported problems by users of the Media Suite, and their solutions. If you find other problems or issues, please [let us know](/contact).

**Note!** Please keep in mind that the Media Suite is only tested in **Google Chrome** for now.

## Playout not working

*Please remember to read also the [FAQ](/documentation/faq/can-play-view) about which sources can be viewed/played via the Media Suite.*

This happens if you are logged into the Media Suite and an audio-visual resource from the Sound and Vision collection is supposed to play, i.e., you get a player window, but the resource does not play, i.e., if you get something like this):

There are at least two ways to solve it:

**First solution**

- In Chrome, go to Settings (using the three dots on the right upper side)
- Go to Advanced 
- Content settings
- Cookies
- And deactivate "Block third-party cookies"
- Note that this would allow other sites to write cookies.

**Second solution**

- Click on the icon with the shape of a cookie where you get the message "This page was prevented from setting cookies" (see below):

  ![troubleshooting1_resource_viewer_not_working](/uploads/troubleshooting1_prevented_setting_cookies.jpg)

- Go to "Show cookies and other site data"

- Click on "Blocked"

- Click on "mediasuite.clariah.nl"

- Click on the "Allow" button below, and "done"

- Click on "Reload"

Now you should be able to play the audio or video. Otherwise, please [Contact us](/contact).
