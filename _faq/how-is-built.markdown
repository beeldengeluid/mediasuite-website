The aim of the CLARIAH Media Suite is to offer an environment that facilitates  access to audiovisual collections in an online research and learning environment that integrates collections and tools. We support institutions in making collections more widely accessible to students and researchers, and provide state-of-the art tools for searching, analysing, enriching and combining data. From a methodological point of view, the Media Suite aims to translate [John Unsworthâ€™s idea of "scholarly primitives"](https://people.brandeis.edu/\~unsworth/Kings.5-00/primitives.html) (Unsworth, 2000) to a digital research environment, so as to offer a wide and diverse array of users essential means to conduct research on digitised audiovisual collections. The Media Suite functions as an aggregator which enables querying, enriching and adding data to audiovisual collections.

The creation of the Media Suite follows a co-development approach: the interface is designed in continuous interaction with users. From the start, scholars have been actively involved in formulating the requirements, prototyping and testing the interface, and we continue to involve scholars in the evaluation of the Media Suite's features.
