In this tutorial, created by Mary-Joy van der Deure and Jasmijn van Gorp (Utrecht University), students learn how to identify 'flow' in archived, linear television recordings. The tutorial provides a theoretical introduction to Raymond Williams' conceptualisation of flow, as well as the Dutch historic broadcasting landscape. This theory is thereafter applied in an assignment where students compare a historic Dutch television schedule with an archived recording in the CLARIAH Media Suite. 

Here, you can find the tutorial itself, as well as the lecturerâ€™s manual that includes points for in-class discussions and reflection:
