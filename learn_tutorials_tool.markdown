On this page you can access Media Suite tutorials per tool or functionality. Most of these tutorials are also accessible via the "Subject tutorials" page but have been ordered according to tool on this page so as to create an overview of how the same tools are used differently in different disciplines. In doing so we wish to stimulate interdisciplinary exchange and discussion among researchers and students that use the Media Suite by focussing on methods rather than disciplines and media specificities. The blue labels below the tutorial introduction texts indicate which tools are discussed in a tutorial.
