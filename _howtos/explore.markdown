The Media Suite offers a tool for [exploratory search](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/tool/exploratory-search). This tool offers the possibility to explore and discover the Media Suite’s collections in an open-ended way. The Explore tool only uses part of the data available in the Media Suite, namely the [Open Images collection](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset?groups=open-images-project) from the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, EYE Film Museum and Natuurbeelden.

## How to use

Steps:

* First, [log in](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/howtos/login) to the Media Suite.

* In the “Tools” menu, choose “Explore.”

* You can start exploring by entering keywords into the search box, by choosing “example searches” under the search box, or by selecting “popular entities” or “recent entities” provided on the home page of the tool.

* Observe that the Explore tool allows you to search and browse based on “entities”:

  * **Media objects**: these are the records of the resources (i.e., video, audio, text, image) of which metadata and, in most cases, the objects itself, are available via the Media Suite. See also [the FAQ section](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/faq/can-play-view) for more information.

  * **People**: names of persons, which have been extracted or identified in the metadata or content of the resources

  * **Locations**: names of places, which have been extracted or identified in the metadata or content of the resources.

  * **Concepts**: terms representing ideas, which have been extracted or identified in the metadata or content of the resources.

* You can also observe the types of relations (derived from the metadata) between the extracted entities:

  * Creator of / created by

  * Has subject / subject of

  * Publisher of / published by

  * Located in / Location for

* You can click on any entity of the type above, and start a navigation journey through the connected (linked-data) entities. This is led by the curiosity of the user, driven by the need to experience serendipitous encounters. In this fashion, exploratory search can lead to discovery of unexpected media resources or surprising connections between other entities .


* Observe the “Exploration path” that appears on the left of your screen. When you click on an entity, you will see a panel opening on the left side. This panel stores your queries, entities, path bookmarks, and personal notes. This means that, every time you click on an entity in the middle panel browser, that entity is stored here. In the Exploration path panel you can:

  * Bookmark entities in this path (use the star icon)

    * Please note that the Bookmark button in the exploration tool saves items and entities in your path. This option is different from the bookmark option when you view objects in the Resource viewer. If you bookmark the resources there, they will be saved in your Workspace


  * Add user comments or notes, by clicking on the three vertical dots on the left side of the bookmark icon and choose “annotate”. These comments are inserted between the entities, they allow you to add commentary to the path, so you can build a “narrative” of your exploration.


  * You can also clear your path, save it, load it, or export it. For these actions, click on the three vertical dots on the right side of the Exploration path menu:

    * If you “Save” your path, you get the option to save it to the Media Suite [Workspace](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/howtos/work-in-a-workspace) . If you click on this option, you will see a pop-up window asking you to select a User project . If you haven’t created a user project, first go to the Workspace to create one.

    * Once you have saved your path, you can visit it in the Media Suite Workspace by going to the User project where you created it, to the tab “Tool sessions.”

    * You can also “Load” (recreate) and “Export” your exploration path.
