**Enhancements**

* the resource viewer update that we have been working on for a number of months is now finally complete in V5.5. In addition to a number of stylistic enhancements, it has new annotation functionalities that allows adding annotations in multiple layers/tiers.
* we integrated support for sharing queries that allows copy-and-paste of your search URL with a queryId so that you can point others easily to your data views. This functionality is also handy for generating data views for the [Media Suite Data Stories](https://mediasuitedatastories.clariah.nl/).
* in the search results we are now highlighting query words found in speech transcripts or OCR so that it is immediately visible how relevant a search result is.     

**Bug fixes**

* we fixed bug that prevented scrolling the metadata in the resource viewer

**Data improvements**

* we connected to the (historical) Tweede Kamer collection that will become progressively available in the Media Suite the coming weeks. 


**Phased out**

* we phased out the possibility to add personal collections to the Media Suite, awaiting a more structural solution within CLARIAH to store personal collections safely.
