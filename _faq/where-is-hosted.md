title: Where is the Media Suite hosted?

---

The Media Suite is hosted at the The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (NISV), which currently acts as one of the [CLARIAH centers](https://www.clariah.nl/over/organisatie/centra). Not all content (media resources) are stored in this data centre though (see [FAQ: Can I play/view all the sources that I find via the Media Suite?](<http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/faq/can-play-view>)).

All tools and components developed within CLARIAH are open source, the Media Suite code is available on the <a href="https://github.com/CLARIAH">CLARIAH GitHub repository page</a>.
