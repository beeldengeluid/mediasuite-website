# Bookmark

To save individual items in the Media Suite, you can use the ‘Bookmark’ function.

* For this, you first need to create a ‘User project’ in the Workspace.

* Once you’ve done this, and you have found an item you want to save, open this item in the resource viewer. You can now click on the orange ‘Bookmark’ button on the right-top side of the screen. This will open the bookmark window.

* In this window you need to create or select a Bookmark group. You can also select the user project you want to save your item in, by clicking on the drop-down menu.

* Click on ‘Save’. You can now find this item in your selected user project.

\
It is also possible to bookmark multiple search results at the same time.

* To do this, go to your search results and select the checkboxes next to the items you want to save.

* Now click on the blue checkmark box at the top of the results list. In this drop-down menu, click on ‘Bookmark selection’.

* Select or create your bookmark group, and select the correct user project.

* Click on ‘Save’. You can now find these items in your selected user project in the Workspace.
