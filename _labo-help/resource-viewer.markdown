### <a name="related-content"></a> Using the "related content (experimental)" block

### <a name="annotate"></a> Annotate resources and items

- In the Resource viewer you can also bookmark and add manual annotations to the media objects. You can do this for the entire media object or for your selected fragments

The control buttons are still under development, but the hotkeys allow you to create fragments. These are the essential keyboard shortkuts:

- i (input key, start from a segment)
- o (output key, end from a segment)
- SHIFT+s (save the segment as an annotation)
- SHIFT+e (open annotation tool in a pop-up)
- SHIFT+n (new segment)

You can find more information about the annotation tool and other keyboard shorcuts [here](/documentation/tools/annotate).
