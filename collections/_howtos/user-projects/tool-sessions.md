Tool Sessions
---

Tool sessions are "snapshots" of the state in which a tool was when you saved your session.

In this section of the Workspace you can access your saved "Tool sessions". At this moment (Version 3), the Media Suite only supports the storage of tool sessions from the "Explore/Browse" tool. Users can also "Save queries" via the Search tool.
