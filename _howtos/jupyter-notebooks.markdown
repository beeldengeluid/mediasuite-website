title: Jupyter Notebooks
---

We offer experimental Jupyter notebooks for those users who prefer working with the data directly using [our APIs](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/apis) and their Python skills. There are four notebooks available, in which we included common functions and code prepared by our experts:

* An introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, to experiment with basic python coding

* To inspect metadata completeness (giving more possibilities than those offered by the Inspector tool)

* To inspect the availability of [ASR](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/faq/is-data-enriched) data using different variables (program title, genre, etc.)

* A workspace notebook prepared for working with data, fetched from the collections’ metadata and ASR and based on bookmarks and annotations added by the users to their workspace.

The notebooks are offered in an authenticated environment. You will need to fill in a form before access is granted: [Request access to the Media Suite’s Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqvhPYT59WQghsQtJ1Sp-r_iCh9m_C8XJZL8eJJYRatGlF5Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Access also requires a VPN connection to the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, as well as a user account: [Take me to the Media Suite’s Jupyter notebooks](http://lechiffre.beeldengeluid.nl:8000/hub/login).

The Media Suite also produces ‘collection notebooks’ to create overviews of the Media Suite’s collection composition. We use some of the visualisations produced with these notebooks to update our Collection pages in the [Data registry CKAN](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/).
