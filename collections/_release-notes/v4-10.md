## Enhancements

- Several bug fixes
- The [collection registry](http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/) (CKAN) infrastructure reinstalled to increase stability. 

## New features

- You can now use a bare bones version of the Media Suite without logging in for collections that are **public domain** such as Open Images, KB Newspaper collection (Via [Delpher](https://www.delpher.nl/)) and Soundbites. Use of the Workspace and features related to the Workspace (such as making annotations) are disabled.  

## Data improvements

- In view of the termination of the DWDD program, we added speech recognition for all DWDD broadcasts to facilitate even more deep dives into the past of the show.

## Work in progress

- To enable access to recent NISV data we are working on connecting the latest version of the NISV catalogue to the Media Suite. As this is a very large data set we are still busy with the process of ingesting, indexing and testing.
- We are preparing the digitized viewing figures data (Kijk- en Luistercijfers) to be added as a collection for the Media Suite
