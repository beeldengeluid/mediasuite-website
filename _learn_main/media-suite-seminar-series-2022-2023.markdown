**Media Suite Seminar Series 2022-2023**

In the academic year 2022-2023, the CLARIAH Media Suite team offers a seminar series (online and on site, scroll down for registration details) that introduces participants to working with the audiovisual collections, tools and methods made available in the Media Suite. Each webinar starts with a theoretical and/or methodological introduction followed by a hands-on session. We start the series with an introductory session focusing on the basic functionalities of the Media Suite, followed by four sessions focusing on different methodologies and functionalities; from searching and bookmarking collections, to cross-media analysis and oral history methods, and qualitative and quantitative analysis using media annotation tools and automated transcripts of media content.

***About the Media Suite***

The Media Suite (https://mediasuite.clariah.nl) is an online research environment for audiovisual collections and media studies research developed within the NWO-funded CLARIAH project. Using their university login credentials, scholars and students in the Netherlands can access key Dutch audio-visual and paper collections, via the Media Suite. Among the collections included are the entire public broadcasting radio and television collection of The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (NISV), the Jean Desmet collection of the Eye Filmmuseum and more than 60 oral history collections from DANS. The Media Suite makes datasets and data enrichments of these collections available that can be explored in the infrastructure with custom-built tools for searching, analyzing, inspecting and comparing datasets. For instance, researchers may search public service broadcast collections using the automatically generated speech transcripts (ASR) of spoken words, or browse the results of optical character recognition (OCR) applied to the Jean Desmet collection’s paper documents.
