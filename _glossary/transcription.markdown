By Roeland Ordelman

Transcription is the systematic representation in written form of  language: speech, sign language, or text in another writing form. In the  academic discipline of Oral History research, transcription is an  essential part of the methodology, as the transcripts are the main  source for analysis of the Oral History interviews. In recent times,  tools such as alignment are emerging that allow Oral History scholars to  simultaneously use text transcripts and the original audio recordings  during analysis. Outside academia, examples of transcriptions are the  proceedings of court hearings or physicianâ€™s recorded voice notes. A  verbatim transcript includes all dialogue spoken, word for word,  including fillers, false starts, and repetitions.

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology is increasingly used to  support or even replace manual transcription. As speech recognition  will produce errors that need to be corrected manually afterward,  specialized tools are developed that try to make the correction work  less tedious.
