Since 2020, the Media Suite has been developing a new format for analysing audiovisual collections quantitatively, and for presenting and contextualising the results of such analysis: Data Stories. Working with the metadata and items of the collections available in the Media Suite, in particular those of the Institute for Sound and Vision, Data Stories allows researchers to combine data visualization, visual analysis of frames from media items and text to explore various topics through data. So far, we have produced two data stories. One story - "15 years of the popular Dutch chat show 'DWDD'"* - in data* - focusses on the development of the hugely popular Dutch television show *De Wereld Draait Door*. A second story - "Factual divergences in Dutch television news: comparisons between AIDS/HIV, SARS and COVID-19 news reportings" - offers a comparative analysis between news reporting on respectively AIDS/HIV, SARS and COVID-19 in Dutch media.
