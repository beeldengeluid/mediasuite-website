**Principle Investigator:** Dr. Berber Hagedoorn, Assistant Professor Media Studies (RUG)

**Project Period:** October 1, 2021 to 1 July 2022

How do Dutch and international MA students, experienced in media
 creation and innovation, use the English-language collections in the
 CLARIAH Media Suite for creative storytelling practices: to search,
 contextualize and share the Media Suite’s cultural heritage content, and to
 engage users with it? The project has a three-pronged approach – focusing
 on the interaction of (a) content, (b) platform, and (c) user – to dig into and
 understand Media Suite use for multimodal storytelling purposes.
 Understanding storytelling in various forms as a sense-making practice and
 as a socio-technical practice, this project combines platform engagement
 analysis with user analysis, both via survey analysis and co-creative userlaboratory
 sessions. This approach triangulates insights into perspectives
 on digital storytelling and media use with first-hand observations of Media
 Suite use, to create (make) new creative storytelling products or
 experiences. It uncovers how students in the international classroom
 perceive the Media Suite platform as an effective storytelling tool.
