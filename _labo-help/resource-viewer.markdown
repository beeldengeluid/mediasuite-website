### <a name="screencast"></a> How to use this tool

\(Forthcoming)

### <a name="play-view"></a> Play and view media

* Play and view the media resources that are available via the Media Suite (for more information about what resources can be viewed or played, read the [FAQ section: Can I play/view all the sources that I find via the Media Suite?](/documentation/faq/can-play-view)

* If the resource has undergone the ASR process [(see more information here)](/documentation/data/automatic-enrichments), you will find an interactive transcript to navigate the audio or video file

### <a name="timeline"></a> Understand the timeline

* If the resource has any automatic enrichments (like ASR) or annotations, they are visible on timelines below the player.

* Interact with the timeline by searching, zooming in/out and scrolling through it by using the buttons above the timeline or using the mouse.

* You can also create annotations on a new timeline by clicking the "Add layer" button and using the keyboard shortcuts outlined in [Annotate resources and items](#annotate)

Important: For long running program's, such as full-day Tweede Kamer recordings, it can look like the timeline is empty for some layers (e.g. sections are so short relative to the program's length the elements are very thin). Be sure to zoom in or out on the timeline.

### <a name="metadata"></a> Understand the metadata block

![metadata_block.PNG](/uploads/metadata_block.PNG)
*An example of a metadata block (Newspapers collection)*

* In the metadata panel you will find top level metadata, with a link to the full metadata.

* There is also a tab called "Content Annotations". Here you will find any enrichments to the data (like ASR).

* Interact with the content annotations by selecting the type, searching through it and clicking on it will move the timeline to the fragment.

The metadata block contains key metadata fields about the resource, such as the description and the resource ID. Different collections have different key fields in the metadata block. Some collections have an ‘ExternalSourceInfo’ link that you can click on to view the resource in an external source, such as the collection owner’s website.

Some categories of metadata fields, such as Persons, have links that you can follow to see more information. When you click on the link icon next to the person, a pop-up opens with links to more information in external sources. See  '[View additional information’](/documentation/howtos/view-additional-information)' for more details.

*Tip*: What appears in the Metadata tab depends sometimes on how metadata fields are filled in for the given collection. Check the collection description in [the Media Suite data registry](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/) for more information.

### <a name="all-data"></a> Understand the "all data" block

* You can also observe the full metadata, as imported from the contributing institution.

  \(more information forthcoming)

### <a name="related-content"></a> Using the "related content (experimental)" block

\(forthcoming)

### <a name="annotate"></a> Annotate resources and items

* In the Resource viewer you can also bookmark and add manual annotations to the media objects. You can do this for the entire media object or for your selected fragments. The annotations end up in the "My Annotations" panel.

The control buttons are still under development, but the hotkeys allow you to create fragments. These are the essential keyboard shortkuts:

* i (input key, start from a segment)

* o (output key, end from a segment)

* SHIFT\+s (save the segment as an annotation)

* SHIFT\+e (open annotation tool in a pop-up)

* SHIFT\+n (new segment)

You can find more information about the annotation tool and other keyboard shorcuts [here](/documentation/tools/annotate).
