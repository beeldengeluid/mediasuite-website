## Bug fixing

- Fixes to the Compare tool (no more bug after selecting too many queries; no more weird behavior if queries have the same ID because of corrupt old data).
- Restyling of the query blocks in the Compare tool.
- Bugs in the Inspector tool have been fixed.

## Data enhancements

- The [collection pages](http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/) have been enriched with visualizations, and the collection descriptions have been updated. 
- It is possible to access the collection pages from the Collection selector, Search, and Inspect tools.
- User-friendly labels have been added to The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (users can now use the user-friendly labels, but also are able to see the original name of the field when hovering the mouse over the labels).
- In the resource viewer, it is possible to see and navigate through the curated segments from The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision collection (curated segments are parts of a program which have been selected and annotated more in detail by the archivists).
- New functions have been added to the Jupyter notebooks.
