This page explains the functionalities available in the ‘Resource viewer’. It will explain how to:

[Play and view media](#play-view)

[Understand the timeline](#timeline)

[Understand the metadata block](#metadata)

[Annotate resources and items](#annotate)


### <a name="play-view"></a> Play and view media

In the resource viewer, you can play and view the media resources that [are available ](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/faq/can-play-view)in the Media Suite. If the resource has  been [ASR processed](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/glossary/transcription), you can also find an interactive transcript with which you can navigate the video or audio file.

### <a name="timeline"></a> Understand the timeline

Under an audio or video file in the Resource viewer, you will find a timeline.

* Interact with the timeline by searching, zooming in/out and scrolling through it by using the buttons above the timeline or using the mouse.

* If the resource has any automatic enrichments (like ASR) or annotations, they are visible on the timeline below the player.

* You can also create annotations on a new timeline by clicking the “Add layer” button and using the keyboard shortcuts outlined in the [Annotate page](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/howtos/annotate).

*Important*: For long running program’s, such as full-day ‘Tweede Kamer’ recordings, it can look like the timeline is empty for some layers (e.g. sections are so short relative to the program’s length the elements are very thin). Be sure to zoom in or out on the timeline.

### <a name="metadata"></a> Understand the metadata block

*An example of a metadata block (Newspapers collection)*

In the metadata panel you will find the top-level metadata. At the bottom of this block, you will also find a link to the full metadata as imported from the contributing institution.

* The metadata block contains key metadata fields about the resource, such as the description and the resource ID. Different collections have different key fields in the metadata block. Some collections have an ‘ExternalSourceInfo’ link that you can click on to view the resource in an external source, such as the collection owner’s website.

* Some categories of metadata fields, such as Persons, have links that you can follow to see more information. When you click on the link icon next to the person, a pop-up opens with links to more information in external sources.

The second tab in this block is labelled “Content Annotations”. Here you will find available enrichments to the data (like ASR). These are interactive, meaning you can search through these annotations or navigate the fragment by clicking through them.

*Tip:* What appears in the Metadata block depends on how metadata fields are filled in for the given collection. Check the collection description in [the Media Suite data registry ](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/)for more information.

### <a name="annotate"></a> Annotate resources and items

In the Resource viewer you can also bookmark and add manual annotations to the media objects. You can do this for the entire media object or for your selected fragments. The annotations end up in the “My Annotations” panel. For more information, visited the [‘Annotation’](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/howtos/annotate) page.
