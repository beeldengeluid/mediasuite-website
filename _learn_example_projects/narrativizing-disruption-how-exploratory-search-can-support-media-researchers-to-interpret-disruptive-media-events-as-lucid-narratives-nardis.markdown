Funded through the CLARIAH Research Pilot grant scheme which ran between 2017-2018, the project "Narrativizing Disruption: How exploratory search can support media researchers to interpret ‘disruptive’ media events as lucid narratives" (University of Groningen) studied how exploratory search can help to understand how 'disruptive' events are constructed as narratives across media, and instilled with specific cultural-political meanings. The project approached this question by the Media Suite's Linked Open Data exploratory search browser DIVE\+, to examine how scholars use and create narratives to understand media events, relying on a mixed-method approach involving various qualitative methods (focus groups, questionnaires, user-generated research diaries, and co-creative design sessions) in combination with an iterative design approach.
