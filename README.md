# Media Suite website

This is the code repository for the website https://mediasuite.clariah.nl

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. To get this website generated on a local machine, you need to install [Jekyl](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.

### Prerequisites

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) version 2.2.5 or above, including all development headers (ruby installation can be checked by running `ruby -v`)
- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) (which you can check by running `gem -v`)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (in case your system doesn't have them installed, which you can check by running `gcc -v`,`g++ -v`  and `make -v` in your system's command line interface)

### Installing

```sh
# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems
gem install jekyll bundler

# Change into your new directory
cd mediasuite-website

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Build the site on the preview server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Now browse to http://127.0.0.1:4000

# Build the source into the /_site directory 
bundle exec jekyll build

# Watch files for changes and automatically trigger build into /_site directory 
# (eg. for development in conjunction with clariah-mediasuite)
bundle exec jekyll build --watch
``` 

## Deployment

Just about any traditional web hosting provider will let you upload files to their servers over FTP. To upload a Jekyll site to a web host using FTP, simply run the `jekyll build` command and copy the contents of the generated `_site` folder to the root folder of your hosting account. This is most likely to be the `httpdocs` or `public_html` folder on most hosting providers.
