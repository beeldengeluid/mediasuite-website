In the Media Suite, it is also possible to export your user projects, your bookmarks and your annotations. You can do so in the workspace.

* **User project**: In the workspace, select the user projects you want to export. A menu will pop-up at the bottom of the page where you can select ‘Export’.

* **Bookmarks**: In the workspace, select the user project in which you have saved the bookmarks. Go to the bookmark tab, and select the items you wish to export. Click on ‘Export’ at the bottom of the page.

* **Annotations**: Select the user project in which you have saved your annotations. Go to the annotations tab, and select the annotations you wish to export. Click on ‘Export’ at the bottom of the page.

The collections’ metadata, and the media objects themself cannot be exported or downloaded. The resulting file from exporting the user data mentioned above is a JSON file.
