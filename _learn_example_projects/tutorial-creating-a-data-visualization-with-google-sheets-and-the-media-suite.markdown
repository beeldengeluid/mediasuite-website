Using the CLARIAH Media Suite, Jasmijn van Gorp and Mary-Joy van der Deure (Utrecht University) have developed a tutorial around the creation of data visualizations. This tutorial helps participants turn data from the CLARIAH Media Suite into a visualization in Google Sheets. At the same time, the tutorial lets participants reflect upon their steps from a critical data studies perspective. \

Here, you can find the tutorial itself, as well as the lecturerâ€™s manual that includes points for in-class discussions and reflection:
