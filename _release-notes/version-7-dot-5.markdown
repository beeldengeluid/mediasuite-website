## New features & bug fixes:

* First of all, the user interface has gotten a big overhaul. Browsing the Media Suite should feel fresh and a easier on the eyes
* A new **collection selector** has been put in place to make it more convenient to find and choose the collection/catalogue/dataset you're interested in
* Bug fix: related persons once more appear for the audiovisual Sound & Vision collections, making it possible again to conveniently browse the Sound & Vision catalogue by person
