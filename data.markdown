The CLARIAH Media suite gives access to important national Dutch audiovisual archives. Among others: 

* [The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/organization/netherlands-institute-for-sound-and-vision)
* [EYE Film Museum collections](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/group/eye-film-institute-netherlands)
* [DANS oral history interview collections](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset/dans-oral-history)
* [Collections from the Open Images Project](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/group/open-images-project)

It works as an aggregator of the metadata, but also enables access to the media content itself. These collections are registered in one instance of a web-based open source management system called CKAN.
