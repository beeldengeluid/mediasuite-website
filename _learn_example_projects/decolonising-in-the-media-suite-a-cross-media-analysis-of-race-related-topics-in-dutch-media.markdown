# Decolonising in the Media Suite: A cross-media analysis of race-related topics in Dutch media

**Principle Investigator:** Dr. Asli Özgen-Havekotte, Assistant Professor Media and Culture (UvA)

**Project Period:** February 7, 2022 to May 6, 2022

This project aims to encourage student-led research using the Media Suite for qualitative analysis of the coverage of race-related topics across Dutch media. It activates students through encouraging them to design and conduct research in autonomous groups. Corresponding thus to the student-activating pedagogy of Decolonising Media Studies elective, this project will involve students forming small groups to research one of the following discussions (including but not limited to): (a) #BlackLivesMatter protests, (b) immigration and refugee ‘crisis’, (c) het racismedebat, or (d) slavery past. After formulating a research question, groups excavate the collections in the Media Suite under the supervision of a lecturer. Subsequently, students search archival metadata and use annotation tools. Based on their findings, they share research results in one of the possible products: discussion paper, in-class presentation, or short desktop documentary. The project ends with recording a video lecture - on students’ findings - for the CLARIAH portal.
