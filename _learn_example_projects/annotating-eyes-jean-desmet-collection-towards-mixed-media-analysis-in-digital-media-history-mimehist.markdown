# Annotating EYE’s Jean Desmet Collection: Towards Mixed Media Analysis in Digital Media History

Funded through the CLARIAH Research Pilot grant scheme which ran between 2017-2018, the project "Annotating EYE’s Jean Desmet Collection: Towards Mixed Media Analysis in Digital Media History" (University of Amsterdam) used the CLARIAH Media Suite components’ annotation functionalities to analyse EYE Filmmuseum’s collection of cinema owner and distributor Jean Desmet. In doing so, the pilot project embedded the digitised film, paper and poster archives of Eye Filmmuseum's Jean Desmet Collection into the Media Suite, while facilitating a mixed media analysis approach to these materials using video annotation.
