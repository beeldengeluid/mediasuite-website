Welcome to Media Suite Learn, the Media Suite's teaching and training initiative. Learn aims to help university lecturers, researchers and students in using the digital audiovisual collections and tools made available in the Media Suite in their teaching, research and study activities. In order to achieve this, Learn offers Media Suite tutorials made for various levels and offers support for research and teaching development, among others by offering concrete examples of research projects and courses that have used the Media Suite. Learn also regularly co-organizes events focussing more broadly on access and reuse of digital audiovisual collections and the use of digital methods and videographic approaches in a wide range of disciplines - in particular media studies, film and television studies, oral history, history and the social sciences.

The following is a list of key activities, ressources and types of support that Learn offers and which you will find more information on in the various sections of the Learn page:

* **Media Suite Tutorials:** Learn offers tutorials tailored to different levels of user expertise ranging from beginner's to advanced levels. The tutorials can be accessed based on subject or tool. Learn offers written, video and hybrid tutorials. These can be found on the tabs "Subject Tutorials" and "Tool Tutorials" respectively.

* **A research resource:** Learn provides examples of how the Media Suite's collections and tools may be used and implemented in teaching and research. This entails a repository of projects and articles focussing on concrete projects, cases and research questions that have been explored using the Media Suite and which may offer inspiration for researchers in developing their own projects. This resource can be found under the tab "Example Projects".

* **Advice and support:** The Learn team aims to support a wide array of approaches and areas of teaching and research, and we are happy to offer advice on how to use the Media Suite productively in your own project. You can reach out to us via [mediastudies@clariah.nl](mailto:mediastudies@clariah.nl)

* **A hub for digital methods and videographic approaches in the Netherlands:** With the Media Suite as the central university level access point for digital audiovisual collections and digital tools for analysis of audiovisual materials, Learn aims to be a hub for digital, audiovisual scholarship in the Netherlands. Our team regularly contributes to organising research events that introduce the Media Suite to new users, and that reflect on digital methods and videographic approaches more broadly. Events include online webinars and public research seminars focussing on state-of-the-art digital scholarship with contributions from scholars from the Netherlands and abroad. Learn's research events are hosted by Utrecht University, where the Learn initiative is currently based.
