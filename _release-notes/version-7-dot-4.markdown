## New features & bug fixes:

* includes similarity search. Note that this functionality requires processing of the archival data which requires a lot of compute. Currently similarity search is therefor available on a limited amount of data for demonstration purposes, so not yet everywhere available and results may vary (e.g., to find another instance of "a drone" we should have processed other videos that have "drones"). 
* includes latest FactRank updates
* includes "reflection features" developed in the OH-Smart project
