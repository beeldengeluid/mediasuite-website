title: What kind of data is available via the Media Suite?
position: 2
---

The Media Suite aims to provide access to **collections and data preserved at cultural heritage and knowledge institutions in The Netherlands**. To access such collections, in the past scholars and students were typically required to visit the various institutions and work with the data in a consultation room setting. With the Media Suite, scholars can stay behind their desktop and have online access to:

* **television**, **radio,** **film, image and paper collections **preserved in the Netherlands, at institutions such as the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, Eye Filmmuseum, National Library, DANS, Meertens Institute and National Archive.

* **collection metadata** from these institutions helping to locate relevant collections and items available outside of the Media Suite 

* a **set of tools to work with the data** and a **personal user space** that allows for storing bookmarked items, annotations, queries and building a corpus.

## Multimedia data

The Media Suite is geared towards working with **multimedia** data sets: audio, video, images and text. Individual collections are typically "single media" (of one media type, for example audio) but some collections are multimedia, such as Eye's Jean Desmet collection that has film (video), poster (images) and digitized papers (text). The Media Suite makes it possible to view and annotate each media type. We aim to facilitate cross-media search and analysis, for example to research correlations between news reports on television (video) and in newspapers (text).

## Collections in the Media Suite

The Media Suite aggregates metadata from audiovisual collections and related sources that are maintained at cultural heritage and knowledge institutions in The Netherlands. For detailed information about the collections, see [the Media Suite data registry](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/).

## Links to external data

Some collections contain links to external data sources. For example, the Sound and Vision collection has links between many of the persons in its thesaurus and information about those persons in WikiData. Check the collection description in the[ Media Suite data registry](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/) to see if links are available and how these have been created.
