Tutorial for CLARIAH Media Suite V4.12 and up\
Tutorial made by Max Broekhuizen, April 2020

# Tutorial Description, Case and Objectives

In this tutorial, you will learn how to compile a corpus of oral history interviews around a specific subject, using the Media Suite search tool and User Project. With this tutorial, you will learn:

* How to search for individual oral history interviews in the Media Suite

* How to bookmark items into a personal user project as to create a corpus of interviews

* How to use the Media Suite for approaching interviews on an individual level, rather than interacting with them through different collections.

Before beginning this tutorial, it is a prerequisite that you know how to log in to and create a user project in the Media Suite. If you are not yet familiar with these aspects of using the Media Suite, please consult the tutorial “Logging In, Workspace and Creating a User Project”.

In this tutorial, you will be working with the aggregated Oral History Collections. These collections that are part of this are harvested from DANS, and gather roughly 3000 oral history interviews on the Media Suite. Because of the different collections, the interviews consist of a wide variety of thematic collections. To read more about what the aggregation of these collections and their contents means, click here.

The main take-away from this tutorial should be that the Media Suite allows you to create a corpus of interviews on the basis of subject, regardless to which collections the interviews initially belonged. To demonstrate this point, the tutorial will use the subject of women’s emancipation as an example. The emancipation of women is discussed in a number of interviews, but since it is such a broad subject, there is not one specific interview collection to do with women’s emancipation. To get a broad sense of what the emancipation of women entailed from interviews, we will use the search tool to collect an as diverse as possible corpus of interviews about the subject.

If you are not yet familiar with working in the Media Suite, it is recommended to follow this tutorial verbatim. If, however, you feel comfortable experimenting it is highly encouraged to do so, as this may be the best way to get a sense of how the search tool works and how to get relevant results that best meet your needs.

This tutorial was also turned into a video series, with one video representing each step. These videos will be embedded in this text. It is up to you if you want to watch each steps video, read its text, or do both.
